Warped-Magic
============

A magic mod for Minecraft.

Getting and putting the source code in an Eclipse environment
------------
1. Get EGit for Eclipse: http://www.eclipse.org/egit/download/
2. Clone the repository using EGit, make sure the location of the repo is at your eclipse workspace location.
3. Create a project with the same name, with the same casing.

You are done!
If you want the mod to work you must have forge installed and a workspace that allows mutiple projects. Don't know how to make the work space? Go to pahimar's Dev environment 3.0 video(http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU3MmJGnqSc) for the environment I use.

All you have to do is submit issues or pull requests! Any redundant requests or issues will be closed.
I am welcome to have translators for the mod! All you have to do is submit an pull request/issue and we'll probably accept it.
